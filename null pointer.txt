The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries, including iostream. Consider the following program −

Live Demo
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
int main () {
   int  *ptr = NULL;
   cout << "The value of ptr is " << ptr ;
 
   return 0;
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −

The value of ptr is 0

Some uses of the null pointer are:
a) To initialize a pointer variable when that pointer variable isn't assigned any valid memory address yet. 
b) To pass a null pointer to a function argument when we don't want to pass any valid memory address.
c) To check for null pointer before accessing any pointer variable.
